Data for Good is a community of data scientists, developers and projects managers, willing to use technology to solve socieatl issues, in the fields of education, health, housing...

As an active member of the community, I will share here thoughts from experience doing data science volunteering: 

- Data for Good Batch #1

    Matching Under-privileged students with the right mentors with the association Frateli
    The project has been covered (in French) by Aliz√©e Breton and available on a medium post: [Frateli Project](https://medium.com/data-for-good/et-si-la-technologie-pouvait-contribuer-%C3%A0-l%C3%A9galit%C3%A9-des-chances-e8318ad29a9c#.5epk3di73)

- Data for Good Batch #2

    Building a tool to automatically detect too expensive housing offers on [pap.fr](www.pap.fr), according to Paris prices regulations
    Hopes are that the application will be included in the dedicated [government webpage](http://www.encadrementdesloyers.gouv.fr/)
    See the [Open Source Repo](https://github.com/dataforgoodfr/batch2_loyers) and the [livestream](https://www.facebook.com/dataforgoodfr/?fref=ts) of the Demo Day at [The Family](https://www.thefamily.co/)
    
- Data for Good Batch #3

    Incoming project tackling the French presidential elections
    
    Some Ideas: 
    
    - Gathering as much data as possible from different sources (text, speech, images, videos)
    - Creating Chatbots to chat with different candidates
    - Creating DataViz to display the candidates positions w.r.t. each other
    
## Paris Summer Innovation Fellowship

The PSIF has been organized for the first time by Five by Five in the summer 2016. The goal was to gather 20 young people in order to tackle a societal issue using technology, within 2 weeks and with mentoring. [summerfellows.paris](http://www.summerfellows.paris/)
The project I've carried out with the French Cour des Comptes is explained in a medium post: [Cour des comptes Project](https://medium.com/@peter.martigny/how-to-evaluate-your-public-service-3f90bbcff31e#.mp696llc0) and has been covered by several national news channel: 
 - [Le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/le-scan-eco/2016/10/19/29001-20161019ARTFIG00007-cette-carte-vous-dit-si-votre-commune-est-bien-ou-mal-geree.php)
